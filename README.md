Newest portfolio in Angular, Dec 28

## Introduction
This is my most recent portfolio. I enjoy making a new one every year to hone front-end skills. I kind-of like the hero section, composed of two images with a parallax scroll effect.
The portofolio page has responsive cards featuring a selection projects, using various ASP.NET technologies, Azure, AWS, Angular, React, MERN-stack, SQL Server, etc.

## Basic missing elements
I need to add a contact form, for sure. I would like to improve responsivenesss and add some visual bells and whistles. I'm thinking some text effects, maybe modals for the portfolio cards,
some witty/silly buttons, a weather app.
